            <dd>Who needs a cottage with an outdoor oasis like this? Designer Erin Feasby of Feasby & Bleeks Design shares her lush, spacious backyard, complete with an outdoor kitchen, hot tub and fire pit. Get her tips for creating a family-friendly outdoor environment that’s both relaxing for adults and fun for kids.
              Erin’s design incorporates different levels, with a raised patio acting as an extension of the indoor family room. A dining table is close to the kitchen for easy entertaining, while a pergola atop the space adds romance. A comfortable seating area with an umbrella overlooks the hot tub, which functions year-round and gets more use than a pool. The outdoor kitchen features a large barbecue and cabinetry that allows for a generous countertop for buffet-style meals. On the lower patio, a river-rock fireplace offers a cozy place to lounge and entertain. Beautiful blue fabrics with paisley and trellis patterns tie the modern-meets-traditional look together.

            <dd>This summer we’re working more on the outside of our house, which includes painting it … ugh!  But I’m also lending a critical eye to our garden spaces. I’ve always wanted a cottage style garden … you know, that riotous floral look with foxgloves stretching high and daisies spilling out of a picket fence. So I searched on Houzz for inspirational cottage garden ideas and came up with 5 ways to achieve this relaxed and sometimes messy look. (Click on photos to be taken to its location on Houzz.)
